		<h1>Upwell</h1>
		<p>
			Upwell is a game that is intended to be fun and educational at the same time.<br>

			The goal of the game is to finish all levels like a classical platformer.<br>

			The serious aspect of the game is to educate the player along the way on the topic of mental health and depression in particular.<br>

			The game mechanics of a typical platformer together with the story are intended to engage the player to make the experience of learning more fun. <br>

			To proceed in the game, the player needs to be able to answer facts around the topic of mental health.<br>

			The required information to answer the questions is provided in the form of hints or conversations throughout the game.<br>

			To encourage the player to pay close attention to the information provided, the player is set back within the level if a question is answered incorrectly.<br>

			The successful experience of unlocking the next part of the level when a question is answered correctly, might increase the learning effect.<br>

			The Level design serves as a metaphor for the mental journey of the main character -
			Going from low light and dark environment to an increasingly brighter mood.<br>

			The starting sequence is a breathing exercise to help the player relax, fitting into the concept of improving well-being.<br>

			The music is selected to have a calming effect as well.<br>
